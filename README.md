This is a project, which on I would like to dive into RoR deeply. These are things I have already done:

1. You can create an user account on sing_up path. I use digest gem to validate and hash password.

3. After you are logged in, you can see your name on navbar with dropdown menu.

4. After selecting "My accounts" on dropdown menu, you can see all your bank accounts and info about them.

5. When you select your preferred account, you can inspect it's transaction history.

6. You can make a new transaction with this easy-to-use form.

7. All transaction as well as all user accounts and bank accounts are verified before they are saved.
